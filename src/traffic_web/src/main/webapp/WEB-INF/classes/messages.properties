about.header=Ontology driven web system.
about.paragraph1=The created system aim is an attempt to integrate database and ontology approach, for storing and inferring desired information about real domain of traffic dangers. For the needs of the system, domain model of traffic danger concept has been built. The ontology has been created using the Protégé editor integrated with description logic reasoner.
about.paragraph2=Ontology domain description is supported by data stored in database. Location details of traffic conditions are stored in database, while clean abstract of traffic danger domain is described by ontology. Such integration results in dynamic deduction possibility of specific facts, using DL reasoning services, instead of using only static relations defined in database. Ontology based approach gives the meaning to the information.
about.paragraph3=Users are allowed to create dynamic questions, and getting results of inferred traffic dangers. That functionality is provided by traffic danger board page. Additionally, system allows trusted users to make changes to locations of traffic conditions occurrence. For working with latest data, provided by trusted users, synchronization mechanism is implemented. Synchronization integrates core ontology, describing the abstract of traffic dangers, with specific real time data. Synchronization process is executed first time on application startup. The startup can be understand as first request to the server while accessing main page. That functionality is also available on demand, after pressing synchronization button. After synchronization, we are cooperating with ontology cached in memory.
about.paragraph4=The project is coded in Java. Dependencies management and versioning is the task of Apache Maven tool. Main technologies used inside are: Postgresql, Hibernate, JSP, Spring MVC, jQuery, The OWL API, HermIT, Log4j.
